Payment \ndeduction will be based on the hours (assigned shift is 24-hours for unoperated equipment) the \nindividual piece of equipment (listed in paragraph (b) of this section) in the IBU was inoperable \nduring the assigned shift, as documented on the shift ticket or commercial invoice. \n \n(b) For calculation of inoperable equipment deductions, hourly rates for the individual resources \nthat make up the IBU shall be calculated as a percentage of the daily rate as follows: \n-Office Trailer; 40% of daily rate \n-Tents; 10% of daily rate \n-Generators/Portable Power Systems; 5% of daily rate/each \n-Handwash Station; 10% of daily rate \n-Stage and/or PA System; 5% of daily rate \n-Light Towers; 7.5% of daily rate \n-Forklift; 7.5% of daily rate \n-Refer; 15% of daily rate \n \n(c) For a IBU component that is unavailable or not in safe and/or operable condition; determine \nthe percentage of the daily rate for the resource by using the following calculation: multiply \ndaily rate by the percentage above in paragraph (b) by converting the percentage into a decimal \nnumber, (i.e. 40% is converted to 0.40). Divide this number by the designated shift or 16-hours if \nno designated shift was established for operated equipment. For unoperated equipment, designated \nshift shall be based on 24-hours to determine the hourly rate for an operational shift. Divide the \nresources hourly rate by the exact quantity requirement of that resource as listed within section \nD.2.1.1 or D.2.1.2 of this solicitation to determine the hourly breakdown rate per item for that \ncategory. Payment deduction amount equals the total of this hourly rate multiplied by the number \nof hours the resource was inoperable. If no resource quantity is identified (i.e. \nGenerators/Portable Power Systems) in D.2.1.1 or D.2.1.2 of this solicitation, the inoperable \npayment deduction amount for resource hours will be calculated using: daily rate multiplied by the \ndaily rate percentage above in paragraph (b), divided by 24-hours, multiplied by the number of \nbreakdown hours, resulting in the total payment deduction amount for each inoperable \nGenerator/Portable power system. \n \nFor Example: \nPer the operating shift on 08/31/XX (date), 1 (resource quantity) Type 1 Tent (resource) was \ninoperable for 6 (hours) from: 0700 – 1300. \n \n$19,000 (Daily Rate) x .10 (Percent of Daily Rate above in paragraph (b)) = $1,900/24 (Hours in \nshift) = $79.17 (hourly rate for shift) /4 (number of resource items identified within section \n\nD.2.1.1 (Type 1) or D.2.1.2 (Type 2) IBU Units) = $19.79 x 6 (inoperable hours) = $118.76 (total \ndeduction amount). \n \nGenerator/Portable Power Systems Example: \nPer the operating shift on 08/31/XX (date), 1 (resource quantity) Generator (resource) was \ninoperable for 6 (hours) from: 0700 – 1300. \n \n$19,000 (Daily Rate) x .05 (Percent of Daily Rate above in paragraph (b)) = $950/24 (Hours in \nshift) = $39.58 (hourly rate for shift) x 6 (inoperable hours) = $237.50 (Total deduction amount). \n \n(d) All other resources in the IBU are paid the full share of the total Daily Rate for that \nresource with the following exception: \n(i) If the resource that is not operable causes another resource in the IBU to become inoperable, \nthat resource must also be converted to an hourly rate and paid only for the hours it was \noperable. \n \n(e) If the resource cannot be repaired, the Government may, at its discretion, allow the vendor to \nreplace the resource with an equal or better piece of replacement equipment in order to make the \n\nResource Categories Accepted by this Solicitation\nIncident Base Unit\nIncident Base Unit Type 1\nIncident Base Unit Type 2\n\nSECTION B - INTRODUCTION \n \n \nB.1 -- BACKGROUND. \n \n(a) The intent of this solicitation is to obtain services described in D.1 Scope of Agreement for Local, \nRegional, and Nationwide fire suppression, all-hazard incidents, and prescribed fire project work. \n \n(b) The Blanket Purchase Agreements resulting from this Request for Quote (RFQ) may be used by \nmultiple State and Federal wildland fire agencies. \n \n(c) Exhibit H contains special contract requirements, to include an open season on-ramping process \nbeing initiated by the Government to ensure adequate resources are available to meet its need. \n \n \nB.2 -- CONTRACT TYPE AND DOLLAR LIMITATIONS \n \n(a) This solicitation will result in multiple agreements. The dollar limitation for any individual order is \nthe Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT). Since the needs of the Government and availability of \nContractor's resources during an emergency cannot be determined in advance, it is mutually agreed \nthat, upon request of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish the resources listed herein to the \nextent the Contractor is willing and able at the time of order. Due to the sporadic occurrence of \nIncident activity, the placement of any orders IS NOT GUARANTEED. \n \n(b) Proposed rates shall include, but are not limited to, labor (as required), equipment, operating \nsupplies, materials, State and Federal taxes (including workers' compensation costs), insurance \ncoverage, transportation costs, overhead, and profit, and any costs/fees necessary to ensure \nequipment/operators/crews meet(s) the specified standards. As required by the agreement, any costs \nassociated with a contractor provided support truck for fuel, maintenance, and operator \ntransportation; delivery/setup/takedown, mobilization/demobilization, power generation, and a \nContractor's representative attendance at the operational period briefings should also be included. \nContractors shall comply with the 2:1 work/rest ratio as outlined in the NWCG Standards for \nInteragency Incident Business Management (Work/Rest Guidelines). When working an average of \nmore than 16 hours, for the duration of the incident, a Contractor may request to negotiate an \nequitable adjustment through the Procurement Unit Leader or Contracting Officer. Shifts exceeding \n16 hours shall be approved by the Incident Commander. \n \n(c) Resources furnished under this agreement may be operated and subjected to extreme \nenvironmental and/or strenuous operating conditions which could include but is not limited to \n\nunimproved roads, steep, rocky, hilly terrain, dust, heat, and smoky conditions. As a result, by \nentering into this agreement, the contractor agrees that what is considered wear and tear under this \nagreement is in excess of what the resource is subjected to under normal operations and is reflected \nin the rates paid for the resource. \n \n \nB.3 -- BASIS OF AWARD \n(a) The Government will award a sufficient number of I-BPAs anticipated to meet incident resource \nneeds resulting from this solicitation to responsible quoters whose quotes conforming to the \nsolicitation will be advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The number \nof I-BPAs awarded will be determined based upon historical usage and other relevant data such as \npredictive services information, available personnel to administer agreements, etc. The USFS will \ndetermine annually whether it is in the Government's best interest to initiate an open season on-\nramping process to add additional Contractors and/or resources during the annual Contracting Officer \n(CO) review period noted in Section C.3.1. \n(b)  Awards to a Government employee or to a business concern or other organization owned or \nsubstantially owned or controlled by one or more Government employees is prohibited (FAR Subpart \n3.6). Public law (18 U.S.C. 208) is additionally established to avoid conflicts of interest between \nemployees interests and their Governmental duties.  Casuals hired under the Administratively \nDetermined (AD) Pay Plan shall avoid decisions or recommendations to include, but not limited to: \nsupervision, hiring, ordering, or recommending payments that directly or indirectly affect a company \nor contractor the casual has any ownership or employment with or for that company or contractor \nassigned to an incident (NWCG Standards for Interagency Incident Business Management  PMS \n902). \n(c) The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: \n(1) Operational acceptability of equipment/resource offered to meet the Government requirement \n(2) Price reasonableness \n(3) Past performance dependability risk \n(d) A quote will be considered operationally acceptable if the offered resource meets the minimum \nrequirements stated in the specifications. \n(e) Price reasonableness may be based upon competition, government estimates, commercial \npricing, historical data, etc.; generally, reasonable pricing that is low will result in higher dispatch \npriority. \n(f) Past performance dependability risk will be assessed as high, low, or unknown (high indicating \nsignificant probability for poor future performance) based upon customer satisfaction as reflected in \nevaluations received for the quoter on incidents and other related experience within the past 36 \nmonths, compliance with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and quoter's history of \nreasonable and cooperative behavior. Pursuant to FAR 42.1501 the contractor's record of integrity \nand business ethics, and generally, the contractor's business-like concern for the interest of the \n\ncustomer will be a consideration of past performance. \n(g) I-BPAs will be awarded only to quoters with: \n(1) reasonably priced resources \n(2) operationally acceptable resources \n(3) a low or unknown performance risk \n(h) The notice of award will be electronically mailed to the vendor's email address as provided in \nVIPR. \nB.4 -- MULTIPLE RESOURCE CATEGORIES/TYPING \nA single resource may be awarded under multiple resource categories and/or typing. However, the \nsame Dispatch Center must be selected for the single resource. In addition, nationally only one award \nwill be made for a resource within each category and/or type. The Contractor may choose to respond \nto solicitations from multiple geographic areas; but upon acceptance of an offer of award, all other \noffers for that resource category and/or type will be ineligible for award. Prospective quoters are \ncautioned to carefully consider the solicitations to which they respond. \nB.5 -- UNRESTRICTED \n(a) I-BPA solicitations will be set-aside for small business concerns unless market research indicates \na need to advertise on an unrestricted basis (i.e. there are not enough small business concerns to \nmeet anticipated needs). If Block 10 of the SF-1449 is checked \"unrestricted\": \n(1) Multiple awards of I-BPAs resulting from this solicitation will be made to responsible business \nconcerns. \n(2) Priority ranking for dispatch will be determined by the method described in D.6.2; no advantage \nwill be given for business size or status in an unrestricted solicitation. \nB.6 -- SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS ADVANTAGE APPLICABLE TO DPL RANKING \n(a) Multiple awards of I-BPAs resulting from this solicitation will be made on a competitive basis to \nresponsible small business concerns. \n(b) Priority ranking for dispatch will be determined by applying a 5% advantage (to the method \ndescribed in D.6.2) for each socioeconomic category (other than small business) checked in Block 10 \nof the SF-1449. A vendor meeting multiple targeted socioeconomic categories will receive multiple \npercentage points with a cap of 10%; for example, if HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, \nand 8(A) are all checked in Block 10 and a vendor qualifies as all three then the advantage will be \n10% for purposes of Dispatch Priority List placement. \n \n \nB.7 -- SUMMARY \n \n(a) The Contractor shall: \n(1) Submit a quote in the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) System.

Vendor is advised to retain all paperwork received and to work directly with the \nIncident Host Agency representatives (IMTs) on incident site-specific requirements (Safe worksite \npractices, self-sufficiency, per diem, etc.) as well as all invoicing (corrections, payment status, etc.). \nSee VIPR website for state forestry and DOI contact information. \nhttps://www.fs.usda.gov/business/incident/state-contacts-requirements.php?tab=tab_c. \n. \nThis Agreement does not preclude the Government from using any Agency or Agency Cooperator \nowned resources before equipment is mobilized under this Agreement. The government also \nreserves the right to utilize other (un-operated or non-mobile) commercial facilities. Orders are based \non Government need and due to the nature of wild land fire, we are unable to forecast agreement \nuse. REMINDER: IT IS THE VENDORS' SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO ADHERE TO ALL LABOR \nLAWS TO INCLUDE PROVIDING THE REQUIRED WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE TO \nALL EMPLOYEES. EACH INDIVIDUAL PERFORMING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS A SERVICE \n\nEMPLOYEE BY DEFINITION. The Government will not track, record, or manage contractor insurance \nrecords or training records under this agreement. Insurance coverage and company employee \ndocumentation is the sole responsibility of the contractor. \n. \nAgreements are valid for three years from date of award. An annual review will be conducted and at \nthe discretion of the Contracting Officer, Contractors may be offered an opportunity to adjust their \nprices during that review period. If a revised price is not submitted during the period set forth by the \nContracting Officer, the prices proposed in the original agreement will remain in effect. In addition, a \nContracting Officer may allow the Contractor to change their Host Dispatch Center and/or Equipment \nAttributes. This annual CO review period may also allow the option of an open season on-ramping of \nadditional contractors and resources. \nNote: Allowable equipment changes will not include the addition of new resources and will not result \nin a change in equipment typing unless the CO has initiated the open season on-ramping process. \nThis open season period is not guaranteed and is at the discretion of the Government. \n. \nAnnual reviews are typically scheduled during the Jan/Feb/Mar timeframe. Non-response by the set \ndue date is vendor acceptance of all VIPR updated annual terms and conditions along with any \nupdated DOL Wage Determination. An inactive SAM account will result in agreement suspension. \nNon-response also nullifies any opportunities to make annual changes to the agreement until the next \nannual review. It is not the Government's intent to modify the agreements during the fire season. This \nis an undue and unacceptable administrative burden. Modifications or inspections outside of the \nannual review window and/or during the active fire season (March - September annually) are not \nstandard practice and may be substantially delayed due to the unavailability of the CO or Contract \nOperations staff. This is not a violation of the agreement. If a vendor chooses to adjust rates as part \nof the annual review/roll over process, those proposed rates are subject to the CO's fair and \nreasonable price analysis for the Region/Zone. If proposed price changes fall outside the acceptable \nparameters, the vendor will be contacted to negotiate the rates to within the acceptable parameters. If \na vendor is unwilling to negotiate or there is not CO approval of proposed roll over modification rates, \nthen awarded VIPR agreement would either be suspended or terminated/cancelled. All negotiations \nmust be complete within the CO determined window or VIPR agreement will be subject to \nsuspension. This acquisition is solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 12, \nCommercial Items, and in accordance with the authority granted in FAR 13.5, Simplified procedures \nfor Certain Commercial Items of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). \n. \nThe USFS will determine annually whether it is in the Government's best interest to initiate an open \nseason on-ramping process to add additional Contractors and/or resources during the annual \nContracting Officer (CO) review period noted in Section C.3.1.  See Section E. \n. \n(c) Agreements are valid year-round, with anticipated highest demand for resources during \n\nMach to October of each year within \nthe RegionsGeographic areas. Potential use outside this place of performance or anticipated use \nperiod could occur at any time, to include any all hazard, fire suppression, and prescribed fire project \nwork performed. Since the resource needs of the Government and availability of Contractor's \nresources during an emergency cannot be determined in advance, it is mutually agreed that, upon \nrequest of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish the resources listed herein to the extent the \nContractor is willing and able at the time of order. \n. \n(d) Any order issued during the effective period of this agreement and not completed within that \nperiod shall be completed by the Contractor prior to release from the ordered incident assignment. \nThe agreement shall govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with respect to \nthat order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the agreement's effective period. \n. \nC.3.2 -- START WORK. \n. \nThe Contractor shall provide availability status to their selected dispatch office as listed within their \nagreement within 10 days  after award of the Agreement.  The dispatch center may require the \nContractor to self-status through the Interagency Resource Ordering Capability (IROC) application. \nIROC is web-based and supports both PCs and mobile devices.  Requesting an account within IROC, \nif required by the dispatch center, should be initiated as soon as possible in advance of fire season \n(See Section D.5  AVAILABILITY). https://famit.nwcg.gov/applications/IROC \n. \nC.3.3 -- AGREEMENT CANCELLATION. \n. \nThis Agreement may be discontinued upon 30 days' written notice by either party. \n. \n \n \nC.4 -- AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL TO PLACE ORDERS \n \nDispatchers, Buying Team Members, Finance Section Chiefs, Procurement Unit Leaders, Contracting \nOfficers, and Purchasing Agents are authorized to place orders against this agreement. Orders must \nbe placed in accordance with established ordering procedures as specified in National and Regional \nmobilization guides. \n \n \nC.5 -- CLAIM SETTLEMENT AUTHORITY \n \nFor the purpose of settling claims, the successor contracting officer is any Contracting Officer acting \n\nwithin their delegated warrant authority, under the clauses of this agreement, and limits set by the \nincident agency. Section C.8 -- LOSS, DAMAGE, OR DESTRUCTION gives guidance on what can be \nconsidered as a damage claim verses damage covered under the Contractor's insurance policy. \n \n \nC.6 -- CHANGES TO AGREEMENTS \n \nChanges to Agreements may only be made by the original signing procurement official or a \ndesignated successor contracting officer (as designated officially in VIPR). If the original signing \nprocurement official or designated successor contracting officer is not available and adjustments are \ndeemed appropriate, an Emergency Equipment Rental Agreement (EERA) shall be executed at the \nincident and shall be applicable ONLY for the duration of that incident. The EERA must include the \nname and location of the incident. Resources that are accepted to the incident are to be utilized as \nthe ordered resource and type per the resource order. \n \nHost Agency accepted noncompliant VIN/SNs or typing not listed on the current agreement would fall \nunder this section and thus, would require a coordinated formal change to the VIPR agreement if the \nsigning procurement official is available or an EERA executed at-incident. Any additional supplies or \nservices requested outside of the awarded agreement also requires establishment of an at-incident \nprocurement instrument for proper payment and compensation. \n \n \nC.7 -- 52.247-21 CONTRACTOR LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY AND/OR PROPERTY \nDAMAGE (APR 1984) \n \n(a) The Contractor assumes responsibility for all damage or injury to persons or property occasioned \nthrough the use, maintenance, and operation of the Contractor's vehicles or other equipment by, or \nthe action of, the Contractor or the Contractor's employees and agents. \n \n(b) The Contractor, at the Contractor's expense, shall maintain adequate public liability and property \ndamage insurance during the continuance of this contract, insuring the Contractor against all claims \nfor injury or damage. \n \n(c) The Contractor shall maintain Workers' Compensation and other legally required insurance with \nrespect to the Contractor's own employees and agents. \n \n(d) The Government shall in no event be liable or responsible for damage or injury to any person or \nproperty occasioned through the use, maintenance, or operation of any vehicle or other equipment \nby, or the action of, the Contractor or the Contractor's employees and agents in performing under this \n\ncontract, and the Government shall be indemnified and saved harmless against claims for damage or \ninjury in such cases. \n \n \nC.8 -- LOSS, DAMAGE, OR DESTRUCTION \n \n(a) For equipment furnished under this agreement WITHOUT operator, the Government will assume \nliability for any loss, damage, or destruction of such equipment, except that no reimbursement will be \nmade for loss, damage or destruction due to (1) ordinary wear or tear, (2) mechanical failure, or (3) \nthe fault or negligence of the Contractor or the Contractor's agents or employees or Government \nemployee owned and operated equipment. \n \n(b) For equipment furnished under this agreement WITH operator, the Government shall not be liable \nfor any loss, damage, or destruction of such equipment, except for loss, damage or destruction \nresulting from the negligence, or wrongful act(s) of Government employee(s) while acting within the \nscope of their employment.

Refer to D.21.8.3(e). \n \n \nD.12 -- TIMEKEEPING \n \nRefer to D.21.9.2 \n \n \nD.13 -- CONTRACTOR'S REPRESENTATIVE \n \nUnless otherwise designated, the contractor's job site foreman shall be considered the Contractor's \nRepresentative for this Agreement. \n \nD.14 -- FIRST AID, MEDICAL COVERAGE AND EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS \n \nD.14.1 -- FIRST AID RESPONSIBILITY. \n \nThe contractor is financially responsible for employee medical expenses and coverage. The \nGovernment may provide first aid at the incident at no charge to the contractor. Any other medical \nexpenses incurred will be the responsibility of the contractor. If contractor personnel become ill or are \ninjured and incident transportation is not available, the Government may evacuate or transport the \ninjured/ill person(s) to a medical facility/hospital utilizing a commercial source (e.g. ground or air \nambulance transport such as Lifeflight). Commercial transport costs will be the responsibility of the \nContractor. \n\n \nD.14.2 -- MEDICAL INSURANCE. \n \nContractor shall provide the operator(s) with an adequate supply of appropriate insurance forms, \ninsurance ID card(s), and other necessary documents. Such documents shall accompany the \ninjured/ill person(s) when the medical need arises. The Government will not track, record, or manage \ncontractor insurance records under this agreement. Insurance coverage and documentation is the \nsole responsibility of the contractor. \n \n \nD.15 -- VEHICLE CLEANING FOR NOXIOUS WEED CONTROL \n \n(a) NOXIOUS WEED CONTROL. \nThe resource shall arrive at the incident or designated inspection point washed and free of noxious \nweed seeds. Equipment with frames and cross-members will be inspected and all debris collecting \nareas including belly pans, guards and coverings must be washed to alleviate the spread of noxious \nweed seeds and to protect against grease and oil-soaked residues catching on fire in belly pans and \nskid plates. Heavy equipment operators shall manually clean tracks and belly pans before leaving \nproject site on all heavy equipment. While at the incident, the Government will normally provide \ncleaning facilities. If the Government requires use of commercial facilities, the Government will \nreimburse the Contractor for these costs based on written receipts. \n \n(b) AQUATIC AND INVASIVE SPECIES (AIS) PREVENTION. \nAll resources under this agreement shall adhere to the requirements of NWCG publication PMS 444, \nGuide to Preventing Aquatic Invasive Species Transport by Wildland Fire Operations, including the \nfollowing measures for Aquatic and Invasive Species prevention: \n \nAll resources that handle water are required to use a functioning foot valve while on assignment. A \nfoot valve must be located at the end of the draft hose; check valves located in the pump, at the tank \nor other locations are not an acceptable alternative. All draft hose(s) and foot valve(s) shall arrive at \nthe incident or designated inspection point clean and dry. The government may, at any time, inspect \nfor compliance with this requirement. \n \n(c) DECONTAMINATING GROUND EQUIPMENT. \nBefore moving to a new water source (in a different watershed), decontaminate all external and \ninternal surfaces of foot valve and draft hose. Three options are: \n1. Power wash with hot water (140 F, allow spray to contact surfaces for 2 minutes) using a hot \npressure washer (e.g., a Hotsy). OR \n2. Dry the gear in the hot sun until completely dry to the touch (sunlight intensifies the \n\ndecontamination process). OR \n3. Use a chemical solution (see Appendix A: Decontaminating with Chemical Disinfectants). Surfaces \nof the drafting hose and foot valve can be decontaminated by coiling and submerging in a bucket \nfilled with disinfectant or by spray application with a backpack pump or a large spray bottle. Consider \ncarrying spare, clean, dry draft hoses and foot valves to switch out with used ones when moving to a \nnew water source. \n*As referenced in the National Wildfire Coordination Group (NWCG) publication PMS 444 Guide to \nPreventing Aquatic Invasive Species Transport by Wildland Fire Operations \n(https://www.nwcg.gov/sites/default/files/publications/pms444.pdf), Chapter 4 Ground Operations. \n \n \nD.16 -- TECHNICAL EVALUATION PROCESS \nD.16.1 -- TECHNICAL EVALUATION \n(a) All resources submitted must pass a Technical Evaluation prior to being considered for award. \nSee technical quote submittal requirements listed in SECTION E -- SOLICITATION PROVISIONS: \nE.1 -- INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS and E.2 -- INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING TECHNICAL \nQUOTES. \n \nD.16.2 -- POST AWARD INSPECTION \n \n(a) All or partial resources offered within your VIPR quote may be selected for follow-on hands-on \ninspection by the Regional Contract Operations program representative.  Those inspections will be \ncoordinated and conducted by that representative. You can find your regional POC at this website \nunder Contract Operation Specialist: \nhttps://www.fs.usda.gov/business/incident/contacts.php?tab=tab_c. \n \n \n \nD.17 -- INCIDENT PRE-USE INSPECTION \n \n(a) All resources furnished under this agreement shall be in acceptable condition. The Government \nreserves the right to reject resources that are not in safe and operable condition. Prior to incident use \nor anytime the resource is under hire, the Government may perform inspections. \n \n(b) If the resource does not pass inspection at the incident or designated inspection station, it is \nconsidered noncompliant. The Contractor may be given 24 hours or time frame designated by \nGovernment representatives to bring the resource into compliance. If the resource does come into \ncompliance within the time granted by the government representative, payment will be made for travel \nto and from the incident or point of inspection, no payment will be made for the time that the resource \n\nwas not available. If the resource does not pass inspection, no payment will be made for travel to the \nincident or point of inspection or return to the point of hire, or for the time that the resource was not \navailable. Upon rejection, resource will be removed from the dispatch priority list until such time that \nthe resource is brought into compliance and re-inspected at the government's convenience. Repeated \nfailures at the pre-use incident inspection may be grounds for cancellation of the Agreement. \n \nD.17.1 -- INSPECTION REPORTS. Copies of the incident inspection reports and related \ndocumentation shall be distributed as follows: \n \n(a) The original shall remain with the fire documents on Host Unit. \n \n(b) A copy of the inspection shall be given to the Contractor and/or the Contractor's Representative. \n \n(c) A duplicate copy shall be forwarded to the CO for all non-compliant resources. \n \n \nD.18 -- NONCOMPLIANCE AFTER ACCEPTANCE AT THE INCIDENT \n \nIf the resource is released due to noncompliance, documentation shall be immediately forwarded, by \nthe Incident Management Team to the Contracting Officer; and the resource will be removed from the \ndispatch priority list until such time that the resource is brought into compliance and re-inspected at \nthe government's convenience (See D.21.8.3(c)). Due to priority of direct support during the fire \nseason, Government workers may be unavailable for both inspections and modifications for an \nextended period of time. Repeated notices of noncompliance may be grounds for cancellation of the \nAgreement. \n \n \nD.19 -- WORKMANSHIP \n \n(a) All work under this Agreement shall be performed in a safe manner to a professional and \nworkmanlike standard. The goal of performance under this Agreement is the suppression of wildland \nfire and other emergency incident responses. The Incident Commander may release from an incident \nassignment any Contractor employee deemed incompetent, unprofessional, careless, or otherwise \nobjectionable including violation of Harassment Free Workplace Policy (Exhibit C). It will be left to the \ndiscretion of the Incident Commander to demobilize an entire resource or to allow replacement of the \nnoncompliant personnel. Documentation of the rationale for release will be provided to the CO \nsubsequent to the action. Accordingly, the Contracting Officer may require, in writing, the Contractor \nremove from use under this Agreement, any employee found incompetent, unprofessional, careless, \nor otherwise objectionable including violation of Harassment Free Workplace Policy. The Contracting \n\nOfficer may require other proof of mitigation. Misconduct may result in the suspension or cancellation \nof this Agreement. \n \n(b) Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring all it's employees wear proper incident attire, as \nfollows (PPE, if required for specific resources, will be detailed in the agreement at D.2): \n(1) FOOTWEAR: Closed toe shoes must be worn while providing services on an incident assignment. \nSandals and/or flip flops are not acceptable footwear while working on an incident. \n(2) CLOTHING: Clothing must be appropriate for the conditions and wildfire/incident setting. This \nmeans long or short sleeve shirts and full-length pants or jeans. \nThe Incident Commander may release from an incident assignment any Contractor employee who is \nnot wearing proper incident attire in accordance with D.19 -- Workmanship. \n \n(c) If an employee or crew is terminated, quits, or otherwise is released from the incident for any \nreason, the Contractor is responsible for returning the employee(s) to the point of hire with a \ndeparture time from the Incident Command Post (ICP) no later than 12 hours or time specified by a \ngovernment official following such decision. The Contractor may, at their discretion, provide such \ntransportation, or request the Incident Management Team (IMT) to arrange for the transportation with \nall transportation costs deducted from Contractor's payment. If the Contractor does not act in a timely \nmanner (i.e., Contractor's employee(s) not departing from the ICP for return to point of hire within the \nspecified time period), the IMT has authority to transport said employee or arrange for employee's \ntransportation and to deduct all such transportation costs from Contractor's payment. \n \nD.19.1 -- INCIDENT BEHAVIOR. \n \nIt is extremely important that inappropriate behavior be recognized and dealt with promptly. \nInappropriate behavior is all forms of harassment including sexual and racial harassment. \nHARASSMENT IN ANY FORM WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. Non-prescription and Federally unlawful \ndrugs and alcohol are not permitted at the incident. Possession or use of these substances will result \nin the Contractor being released from the incident. During off-incident periods, personnel are \nresponsible for proper conduct and maintenance of fitness for duty. Drug or alcohol abuse resulting in \nunfitness for duty will normally result in the Contractor being released from the incident. Sexual \nharassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favors, and other verbal or \nphysical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to such \nconduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, (2) \nsubmission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment \ndecisions affecting such individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably \ninterfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive \nworking environment. \n \n\n \nD.20 -- PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS \n \nPerformance evaluations will be performed at the incident using the form in Exhibit E. The evaluation \nwill be completed at the incident by the government representative supervising the work. This form is \nthe preferred performance evaluation to be accepted by the Contracting Officer. The evaluator's \nsignature shall be legible and printed on the form. If the supervising Government representative is \nreleased from the incident prior to the release of the resource, the government representative will \ncomplete a performance evaluation prior to demobilization, for work the resource performed under \ntheir supervision. The Government representative will review the performance evaluation with the \nContractor, record Contractor comments, and obtain the Contractor's signature acknowledging \ncompletion of the evaluation. The Government evaluator will then give a copy of the evaluation \nform(s) to the Contractor at the incident and submit a copy to the incident Finance Section (for \ndistribution to the Contracting Office and the Host unit incident file). Completed Performance \nEvaluations can be emailed to the following email address: Perform.ct5w8ujitbvot9yi@u.box.com. \n \n \nD.21 -- PAYMENTS \n \n(a) Payments will be made in accordance with D.21.8. \n \n(b) When equipment is ordered for severity assignments as Prescribed Fire Project Work, the \nfollowing payment will be made: \n \n(c) Table D.21 -- SEVERITY INCIDENTS & PRESCRIBED FIRE PROJECT RATES \n \nSeverity Incidents & Prescribed Fire Project Rates are paid at 75% of the daily rate for 10 hours or \nless, excluding meal breaks. For greater than 10 hours, including travel time, the full daily rate \napplies. \n \nSeverity only: If a resource is mobilized to an incident within the 10-hour severity period the payment \nwill revert to the full daily rate. If the mobilization occurs outside the 10-hour severity period they will \nbe released from their severity assignment and the suppression rates will be applied under the first \nand last day language of the Agreement. In no case shall the daily rate be exceeded. \n(1) Severity Incident assignments & Prescribed Fire Project Work are at the discretion of the \nContractor to accept or reject. Rejecting either a severity assignment or prescribed fire project work \nwill not affect placement on the suppression dispatch priority list (DPL) or preclude a Contractor from \nbeing offered a suppression assignment at full daily rate. \n(2) Severity Incident assignments & Prescribed Fire Project Work often are not associated with a \n\nformal incident base camp where meals and campsites are provided. If a base camp is not \nestablished, RON (see D.21.5) may or may not be authorized at the Government's discretion, and this \nallowance will be annotated on the Resource Order (RO). \n \nD.21.1 -- BRIEFINGS. \n \nAll operators/Contractor Representatives shall attend operational period briefings. This is included in \nthe daily rate. \n \nD.21.2 -- WITHDRAWAL OF RESOURCE(S). \n \nRefer to D.21.8.3(b). \n \nD.21.3 -- REPAIRS. \n \nRepairs shall be made and paid for by the Contractor. The Government may, at its option, elect to \nmake such repairs when necessary to keep the resource operating. The cost of such repairs will be \n$100 per hour, plus parts and will be deducted from payment to the contractor. \n \nD.21.4 -- OPERATING SUPPLIES. \n \nEven though this agreement may specify that all operating supplies are to be furnished by the \nContractor, the Government may, at its option, elect to furnish such supplies when necessary to keep \nthe resource operating. The cost of such supplies will be determined by the Government and \ndeducted from payment to the Contractor. \n \nD.21.5 -- REMAIN OVERNIGHT ALLOWANCE (RON). \n \n(a) Contractors under this agreement are not paid per diem or lodging expenses to and from \nincidents. \n \n(b) When the Government cannot provide a campsite after the first shift worked, the Government will \npay actual lodging expenses or the per diem locality rate published by the U.S. General Services \nAdministration (GSA) web site (www.gsa.gov), whichever is less. Double occupancy of hotel rooms is \nrequired. If the crew has an odd number of male or female crew members, an additional room may be \nauthorized. Any associated lodging taxes are reimbursable as documented. Lodging receipts, as well \nas documentation by incident personnel that a campsite was not provided, shall be submitted as \nsupporting documentation with payment documents. \n \n\n(c) Reimbursement for meals and incidental expenses (M&IE) is based on per diem locality rates \nminus any Government-provided meals. The maximum allowable rates are referenced at \nwww.gsa.gov. As with lodging, actual meal expenses may be authorized as coordinated in advance \nand managed by the Host Agency and/or IMT. \n \n(d) If warranted by a lack of available lodging at established rates, actual lodging expenses may be \nauthorized. Authorization must be coordinated in advance and documented in writing by a Host \nAgency Administrator (AA) or local Agency Incident Business Specialist on either an ICS-213 general \nmessage form in or in the remarks on the Resource Order (RO). Actuals will not exceed the current \nFTR allowances per FTR Bulletin 18-09 or latest published bulletin  calculating actual expense \nreimbursement located here: https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulation/federal-travel-\nregulation?gsaredirect=ftr. \n \n(e) If the resource is allowed to return to its dispatch location during off-shift time, RON allowance is \nnot authorized. \n \n(f) The maximum RON that shall be allowed is based on the number of operators or crewmembers \nshown on the shift ticket. Payment shall be included as an addition on the OF-286 Emergency \nEquipment Use Invoice. \n \nD.21.6 -- FOOD & DRINK. \n \n(a) Contractors are required to provide sufficient food & drink to support their employee(s) while in \ntravel status and the first shift of the incident. This is not reimbursed by the Government. \n \n(b) After that time, when Government subsistence at incident camps is available, meals for \nContractor's operator(s) will be furnished without charge. Government will furnish meals without cost \nif restaurant subsistence is the approved camp for incident personnel. \n \n(c) The Government, during demobilization and/or reassignment, may provide sack lunches to the \nContractor personnel without charging the Contractor. \n \n(d) Severity Incident assignments & Prescribed Fire Project Work often are not associated with a \nformal incident base camp where meals and campsites are provided. If a base camp is not \nestablished, RON (see D.21.5) and FOOD & DRINK (D.21.6) may or may not be authorized at the \nGovernment's discretion, and this allowance will be annotated on the Resource Order (RO). \n \nD.21.7 -- ORDER CANCELLATION. \n \n\nOrder cancellation/enroute. If the order is cancelled after the resource order has been confirmed, and \nthe resource is enroute, the resource is considered mobilized. Payment will be made by the host \nagency in accordance with D.21.8. \n \nD.21.8 -- PAYMENTS. \n \n(a) The ordering agency is responsible for payments. Payments for resources shared between \nincidents without reassignment in IROC will be the responsibility of the original ordering agency. See \nExhibit B for complete agency payment office information. \n \n(b) The time under hire shall start at the time the resource begins traveling to the incident after being \nordered by the Government, and end at the estimated time of arrival back to the point of hire after \nbeing released, except as provided in D.21.8.3. \n \n(c) The minimum daily guarantee for the transport is applicable to time under hire as defined in \nD.21.8. \n \nD.21.8.1 -- Rates of Payments.

It is not the Government's intent to modify and have an open avenue for \ncontinuous changes to the agreements during the fire seasons. \n. \n(b) Additional resources may not be added to the agreement unless an open season on-ramping \nprocess is initiated during the annual roll over/CO review timeframe. \n. \n \n \nD.23 -- LIST OF DOCUMENTS, EXHIBITS, AND OTHER ATTACHMENTS \n \nProvided as a separate attachment \n \n \nSECTION E - SOLICITATION PROVISIONS \n \n \nE.1 - INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS \n\n52.212-1 -- Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (SEP 2023) \n \n(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. \nThe NAICS code(s) and small business size standard(s) for this acquisition appear elsewhere in the \nsolicitation. However, the small business size standard for a concern that submits an offer, other than \non a construction or service acquisition, but proposes to furnish an end item that it did not itself \nmanufacture, process, or produce is 500 employees if the acquisition \n(1)Is set aside for small business and has a value above the simplified acquisition threshold; \n(2)Uses the HUBZone price evaluation preference regardless of dollar value, unless the offeror \nwaives the price evaluation preference; or \n(3)Is an 8(a), HUBZone, service-disabled veteran-owned, economically disadvantaged women-\nowned, or women-owned small business set-aside or sole-source award regardless of dollar value. \n \n(b) Submission of offers. See B.7 -- SUMMARY. \n \n(c) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. \n(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so \nas to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the \nsolicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the \ndesignated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. \n(2) (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office \ndesignated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is \"late\" and will not be \nconsidered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that \naccepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and- \n(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was \nreceived at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one \nworking day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or \n(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation \ndesignated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for \nreceipt of offers; or \n(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. \n(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable \nto the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. \n(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the \ntime/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt \nmaintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. \n(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers \ncannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time \nspecified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the \n\nsolicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers \nwill be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work \nday on which normal Government processes resume. \n(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for \nreceipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation \nauthorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the \nexact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning \nfacsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, \nbefore the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is \nestablished and the person signs a receipt for the offer. \n \n(d) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers \nand award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should \ncontain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government \nreserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be \nnecessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept \nother than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. \n \n(e) Unique entity identifier.(Applies to all offers that exceed the micro-purchase threshold, and offers \nat or below the micro-purchase threshold if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in \nthe System for Award Management (SAM). The Offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and \naddress on the cover page of its offer, the annotation \"Unique Entity Identifier\" followed by the unique \nentity identifier that identifies the Offeror's name and address. The Offeror also shall enter its \nElectronic Funds Transfer (EFT) indicator, if applicable. The EFT indicator is a four-character suffix to \nthe unique entity identifier.

The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: \n \nThe contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to \nreimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the \nresponsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona \nﬁde collective bargaining agreement providing for a diﬀerent amount, or the furnishing of contrary aﬃrmative proof as to the actual \ncost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in  \nthose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of \"wash and wear\" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with \nother personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in \norder to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by \nthe nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. \n \n** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS ** \n \nThe duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the \"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations\", Fifth \nEdition (Revision 1), dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated. \n \nREQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE Standard Form 1444 (SF-1444) \n \nConformance Process: \n \nThe contracting oﬃcer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under \nthe contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classiﬁcation listed in the wage determination), be classiﬁed by \nthe contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted \nclassiﬁcations and the classiﬁcations listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the \nmonetary wages and furnished the fringe beneﬁts as are determined (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be \ninitiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees (See 29 CFR \n4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a ﬁnal determination of conformed classiﬁcation, wage rate, and/or fringe \nbeneﬁts which shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iv)(C)(vi)). When multiple wage \ndeterminations are included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is \nto be conformed. \n \nThe process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: \n \n1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identiﬁes the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). \n \n2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order the proposed classiﬁcation title(s), a Federal grade \nequivalency (FGE) for each proposed classiﬁcation(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including \ninformation regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is \nno authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting oﬃcer no later than 30 \ndays after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. \n \n3) The contracting oﬃcer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's \nrecommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour \nDivision, U.S. Department of Labor, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). \n \n4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modiﬁes, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency \ncontracting oﬃcer, or notiﬁes the contracting oﬃcer that additional time will be required to process the request. \n \n5) The contracting oﬃcer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. \n \n6) The contractor informs the aﬀected employees. \n \nInformation required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper. \n \n\nWhen preparing a conformance request, the \"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations\" (the Directory) should be used to \ncompare job deﬁnitions to ensure that duties requested are not performed by a classiﬁcation already listed in the wage \ndetermination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established \nwage determination. Conformances may not be used to artiﬁcially split, combine, or subdivide classiﬁcations listed in the wage \ndetermination. \n \n** OCCUPATIONS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SCA DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **        \n \nAircraft Quality Control Inspector \nDevelops and implements quality control and ground safety programs to ensure compliance with contract speciﬁcations.

Since wildland fire support and locations are unknown at time of award, selection of a host dispatch center/zone outside of where the resources reside may result in loss of opportunity and failure to meet Government's critical and timely need at time of incident.

The dollar limitation for any individual order is \nthe Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT). Since the needs of the Government and availability of \nContractor's resources during an emergency cannot be determined in advance, it is mutually agreed \nthat, upon request of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish the resources listed herein to the \nextent the Contractor is willing and able at the time of order. Due to the sporadic occurrence of \nIncident activity, the placement of any orders IS NOT GUARANTEED. \n \n(b) Proposed rates shall include, but are not limited to, labor (as required), equipment, operating \nsupplies, materials, State and Federal taxes (including workers' compensation costs), insurance \ncoverage, transportation costs, overhead, and profit, and any costs/fees necessary to ensure \nequipment/operators/crews meet(s) the specified standards. As required by the agreement, any costs \nassociated with a contractor provided support truck for fuel, maintenance, and operator \ntransportation; delivery/setup/takedown, mobilization/demobilization, power generation, and a \nContractor's representative attendance at the operational period briefings should also be included. \nContractors shall comply with the 2:1 work/rest ratio as outlined in the NWCG Standards for \nInteragency Incident Business Management (Work/Rest Guidelines). When working an average of \nmore than 16 hours, for the duration of the incident, a Contractor may request to negotiate an \nequitable adjustment through the Procurement Unit Leader or Contracting Officer. Shifts exceeding \n16 hours shall be approved by the Incident Commander. \n \n(c) Resources furnished under this agreement may be operated and subjected to extreme \nenvironmental and/or strenuous operating conditions which could include but is not limited to \n\nunimproved roads, steep, rocky, hilly terrain, dust, heat, and smoky conditions. As a result, by \nentering into this agreement, the contractor agrees that what is considered wear and tear under this \nagreement is in excess of what the resource is subjected to under normal operations and is reflected \nin the rates paid for the resource. \n \n \nB.3 -- BASIS OF AWARD \n(a) The Government will award a sufficient number of I-BPAs anticipated to meet incident resource \nneeds resulting from this solicitation to responsible quoters whose quotes conforming to the \nsolicitation will be advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The number \nof I-BPAs awarded will be determined based upon historical usage and other relevant data such as \npredictive services information, available personnel to administer agreements, etc. The USFS will \ndetermine annually whether it is in the Government's best interest to initiate an open season on-\nramping process to add additional Contractors and/or resources during the annual Contracting Officer \n(CO) review period noted in Section C.3.1. \n(b)  Awards to a Government employee or to a business concern or other organization owned or \nsubstantially owned or controlled by one or more Government employees is prohibited (FAR Subpart \n3.6). Public law (18 U.S.C. 208) is additionally established to avoid conflicts of interest between \nemployees interests and their Governmental duties.  Casuals hired under the Administratively \nDetermined (AD) Pay Plan shall avoid decisions or recommendations to include, but not limited to: \nsupervision, hiring, ordering, or recommending payments that directly or indirectly affect a company \nor contractor the casual has any ownership or employment with or for that company or contractor \nassigned to an incident (NWCG Standards for Interagency Incident Business Management  PMS \n902). \n(c) The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: \n(1) Operational acceptability of equipment/resource offered to meet the Government requirement \n(2) Price reasonableness \n(3) Past performance dependability risk \n(d) A quote will be considered operationally acceptable if the offered resource meets the minimum \nrequirements stated in the specifications. \n(e) Price reasonableness may be based upon competition, government estimates, commercial \npricing, historical data, etc.; generally, reasonable pricing that is low will result in higher dispatch \npriority. \n(f) Past performance dependability risk will be assessed as high, low, or unknown (high indicating \nsignificant probability for poor future performance) based upon customer satisfaction as reflected in \nevaluations received for the quoter on incidents and other related experience within the past 36 \nmonths, compliance with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and quoter's history of \nreasonable and cooperative behavior. Pursuant to FAR 42.1501 the contractor's record of integrity \nand business ethics, and generally, the contractor's business-like concern for the interest of the \n\ncustomer will be a consideration of past performance. \n(g) I-BPAs will be awarded only to quoters with: \n(1) reasonably priced resources \n(2) operationally acceptable resources \n(3) a low or unknown performance risk \n(h) The notice of award will be electronically mailed to the vendor's email address as provided in \nVIPR. \nB.4 -- MULTIPLE RESOURCE CATEGORIES/TYPING \nA single resource may be awarded under multiple resource categories and/or typing. However, the \nsame Dispatch Center must be selected for the single resource. In addition, nationally only one award \nwill be made for a resource within each category and/or type. The Contractor may choose to respond \nto solicitations from multiple geographic areas; but upon acceptance of an offer of award, all other \noffers for that resource category and/or type will be ineligible for award. Prospective quoters are \ncautioned to carefully consider the solicitations to which they respond. \nB.5 -- UNRESTRICTED \n(a) I-BPA solicitations will be set-aside for small business concerns unless market research indicates \na need to advertise on an unrestricted basis (i.e. there are not enough small business concerns to \nmeet anticipated needs). If Block 10 of the SF-1449 is checked \"unrestricted\": \n(1) Multiple awards of I-BPAs resulting from this solicitation will be made to responsible business \nconcerns. \n(2) Priority ranking for dispatch will be determined by the method described in D.6.2; no advantage \nwill be given for business size or status in an unrestricted solicitation. \nB.6 -- SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS ADVANTAGE APPLICABLE TO DPL RANKING \n(a) Multiple awards of I-BPAs resulting from this solicitation will be made on a competitive basis to \nresponsible small business concerns. \n(b) Priority ranking for dispatch will be determined by applying a 5% advantage (to the method \ndescribed in D.6.2) for each socioeconomic category (other than small business) checked in Block 10 \nof the SF-1449. A vendor meeting multiple targeted socioeconomic categories will receive multiple \npercentage points with a cap of 10%; for example, if HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, \nand 8(A) are all checked in Block 10 and a vendor qualifies as all three then the advantage will be \n10% for purposes of Dispatch Priority List placement. \n \n \nB.7 -- SUMMARY \n \n(a) The Contractor shall: \n(1) Submit a quote in the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) System.

Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, \nthe full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es): \nhttps://acquisition.gov/far/. \n \n52.212-3 -- Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (MAY 2024) \nNOTE: Offerors who have not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically \nin the System of Award Management (SAM) or who have changes to their reps and certs need to \ncomplete or update their information in SAM in order to be eligible for award. See Section E.3. \n52.212-4 -- Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items (NOV 2023) \n52.223-1 -- Biobased Product Certification (MAY 2024). \nNOTE: This procurement requires the use of biobased products to the extent that such products are \nreasonably available, meet agency or relevant industry performance standards, and are reasonably \npriced. Where available, these products should first be acquired from among qualified products that \nfall under the umbrella of items designated through the Federal Biobased Products Preferred \nProcurement Program (FB4P). Information is available at: http://www.biopreferred.gov/. \n52.223-2 -- Reporting of Biobased Products Under Service and Construction Contracts (MAY 2024) \n52.236-7 -- Permits and Responsibilities (NOV 1991) \n52.245-1 -- Government Property (SEP 2021) \n \nC.2.1 -- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRING VENDOR CERTIFICATION. \n \nThis is to notify you of recent award prohibitions contained in sections 744 and 745 of Division E, Title \nVII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235) regarding \ncorporate felony convictions and corporate tax delinquencies. Under the Appropriations Act, no \nawards can be made to any corporation (for profit or non-profit) that has a tax delinquency or felony \nconviction as defined in the Appropriations Act and described in the attached representation. To \ncomply with these provisions, all offerors are required to complete the representation in SAM. Please \nnote that if you have a tax delinquency or felony conviction, as defined in the Appropriations Act and \ndescribed in the attached representation, you are not eligible for award. If you are ineligible for award \nbecause of these prohibitions it is possible that you can regain eligibility for award, but only if the \nsuspension and debarring official considers your tax delinquency and/or felony conviction and \ndetermines that suspension or debarment is not necessary to protect the interests of the Government. \n \n\nC.2.2 -- ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS. \n \n(a) Assignment of claims is not authorized. \n \n(b) In accordance with FAR Part 32.803, it is determined prohibiting assignment of claims against this \nI-BPA and any resultant resource order is in the Government's interest. \n \n(c) Pursuant to FAR 52.212-4, vendors shall not change the name or address for EFT payments in \nthe SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of the assignment of claims. \n \n \nC.3 -- PLACE OF PERFORMANCE AND PERFORMANCE PERIODS \n. \nC.3.1 -- AGREEMENT PERIOD. \n. \n(a) Estimated date of award is \nOn or around June 1,2025, with annual review modifications for duration of the VIPR agreement. An \ninactive SAM account will result in agreement suspension.  Non-response to annual review \nmodifications will also nullify any opportunities to make annual changes to the agreement or \nparticipate in the on-ramping process, if available, until the next annual review.  . The Agreement \nperiod is for \nthree (3)  years from the date of award. \n. \n \n(b) NO ORDERS OR PAYMENTS ARE GUARANTEED DURING THE DURATION OF THE \nAGREEMENT PERIOD, REGARDLESS OF LENGTH. Each BPA Call/Dispatch is initiated, \nadministered, and invoiced/paid through the Incident Host Agency, which may or may not be the US \nForest Service. Vendor is advised to retain all paperwork received and to work directly with the \nIncident Host Agency representatives (IMTs) on incident site-specific requirements (Safe worksite \npractices, self-sufficiency, per diem, etc.) as well as all invoicing (corrections, payment status, etc.). \nSee VIPR website for state forestry and DOI contact information. \nhttps://www.fs.usda.gov/business/incident/state-contacts-requirements.php?tab=tab_c. \n. \nThis Agreement does not preclude the Government from using any Agency or Agency Cooperator \nowned resources before equipment is mobilized under this Agreement. The government also \nreserves the right to utilize other (un-operated or non-mobile) commercial facilities. Orders are based \non Government need and due to the nature of wild land fire, we are unable to forecast agreement \nuse. REMINDER: IT IS THE VENDORS' SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO ADHERE TO ALL LABOR \nLAWS TO INCLUDE PROVIDING THE REQUIRED WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE TO \n\nALL EMPLOYEES. EACH INDIVIDUAL PERFORMING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS A SERVICE \nEMPLOYEE BY DEFINITION. The Government will not track, record, or manage contractor insurance \nrecords or training records under this agreement. Insurance coverage and company employee \ndocumentation is the sole responsibility of the contractor. \n. \nAgreements are valid for three years from date of award. An annual review will be conducted and at \nthe discretion of the Contracting Officer, Contractors may be offered an opportunity to adjust their \nprices during that review period. If a revised price is not submitted during the period set forth by the \nContracting Officer, the prices proposed in the original agreement will remain in effect. In addition, a \nContracting Officer may allow the Contractor to change their Host Dispatch Center and/or Equipment \nAttributes. This annual CO review period may also allow the option of an open season on-ramping of \nadditional contractors and resources. \nNote: Allowable equipment changes will not include the addition of new resources and will not result \nin a change in equipment typing unless the CO has initiated the open season on-ramping process. \nThis open season period is not guaranteed and is at the discretion of the Government. \n. \nAnnual reviews are typically scheduled during the Jan/Feb/Mar timeframe. Non-response by the set \ndue date is vendor acceptance of all VIPR updated annual terms and conditions along with any \nupdated DOL Wage Determination. An inactive SAM account will result in agreement suspension. \nNon-response also nullifies any opportunities to make annual changes to the agreement until the next \nannual review. It is not the Government's intent to modify the agreements during the fire season. This \nis an undue and unacceptable administrative burden. Modifications or inspections outside of the \nannual review window and/or during the active fire season (March - September annually) are not \nstandard practice and may be substantially delayed due to the unavailability of the CO or Contract \nOperations staff. This is not a violation of the agreement. If a vendor chooses to adjust rates as part \nof the annual review/roll over process, those proposed rates are subject to the CO's fair and \nreasonable price analysis for the Region/Zone. If proposed price changes fall outside the acceptable \nparameters, the vendor will be contacted to negotiate the rates to within the acceptable parameters. If \na vendor is unwilling to negotiate or there is not CO approval of proposed roll over modification rates, \nthen awarded VIPR agreement would either be suspended or terminated/cancelled. All negotiations \nmust be complete within the CO determined window or VIPR agreement will be subject to \nsuspension. This acquisition is solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 12, \nCommercial Items, and in accordance with the authority granted in FAR 13.5, Simplified procedures \nfor Certain Commercial Items  of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). \n. \nThe USFS will determine annually whether it is in the Government's best interest to initiate an open \nseason on-ramping process to add additional Contractors and/or resources during the annual \nContracting Officer (CO) review period noted in Section C.3.1.  See Section E.. \n(c) Agreements are valid year-round, with anticipated highest demand for resources during \n\nMarch to October of each year within \nthe RegionsGeographic areas. Potential use outside this place of performance or anticipated use \nperiod could occur at any time, to include any all hazard, fire suppression, and prescribed fire project \nwork performed. Since the resource needs of the Government and availability of Contractor's \nresources during an emergency cannot be determined in advance, it is mutually agreed that, upon \nrequest of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish the resources listed herein to the extent the \nContractor is willing and able at the time of order. \n. \n(d) Any order issued during the effective period of this agreement and not completed within that \nperiod shall be completed by the Contractor prior to release from the ordered incident assignment. \nThe agreement shall govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with respect to \nthat order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the agreement's effective period. \n. \nC.3.2 -- START WORK. \n. \nThe Contractor shall provide availability status to their selected dispatch office as listed within their \nagreement within 10 days  after award of the Agreement.  The dispatch center may require the \nContractor to self-status through the Interagency Resource Ordering Capability (IROC) application. \nIROC is web-based and supports both PCs and mobile devices.  Requesting an account within IROC, \nif required by the dispatch center, should be initiated as soon as possible in advance of fire season \n(See Section D.5  AVAILABILITY). https://famit.nwcg.gov/applications/IROC \n. \nC.3.3 -- AGREEMENT CANCELLATION. \n. \nThis Agreement may be discontinued upon 30 days' written notice by either party. \n. \n \n \nC.4 -- AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL TO PLACE ORDERS \n \nDispatchers, Buying Team Members, Finance Section Chiefs, Procurement Unit Leaders, Contracting \nOfficers, and Purchasing Agents are authorized to place orders against this agreement. Orders must \nbe placed in accordance with established ordering procedures as specified in National and Regional \nmobilization guides. \n \n \nC.5 -- CLAIM SETTLEMENT AUTHORITY \n \nFor the purpose of settling claims, the successor contracting officer is any Contracting Officer acting \n\nwithin their delegated warrant authority, under the clauses of this agreement, and limits set by the \nincident agency. Section C.8 -- LOSS, DAMAGE, OR DESTRUCTION gives guidance on what can be \nconsidered as a damage claim verses damage covered under the Contractor's insurance policy. \n \n \nC.6 -- CHANGES TO AGREEMENTS \n \nChanges to Agreements may only be made by the original signing procurement official or a \ndesignated successor contracting officer (as designated officially in VIPR). If the original signing \nprocurement official or designated successor contracting officer is not available and adjustments are \ndeemed appropriate, an Emergency Equipment Rental Agreement (EERA) shall be executed at the \nincident and shall be applicable ONLY for the duration of that incident. The EERA must include the \nname and location of the incident. Resources that are accepted to the incident are to be utilized as \nthe ordered resource and type per the resource order. \n \nHost Agency accepted noncompliant VIN/SNs or typing not listed on the current agreement would fall \nunder this section and thus, would require a coordinated formal change to the VIPR agreement if the \nsigning procurement official is available or an EERA executed at-incident. Any additional supplies or \nservices requested outside of the awarded agreement also requires establishment of an at-incident \nprocurement instrument for proper payment and compensation. \n \n \nC.7 -- 52.247-21 CONTRACTOR LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY AND/OR PROPERTY \nDAMAGE (APR 1984) \n \n(a) The Contractor assumes responsibility for all damage or injury to persons or property occasioned \nthrough the use, maintenance, and operation of the Contractor's vehicles or other equipment by, or \nthe action of, the Contractor or the Contractor's employees and agents. \n \n(b) The Contractor, at the Contractor's expense, shall maintain adequate public liability and property \ndamage insurance during the continuance of this contract, insuring the Contractor against all claims \nfor injury or damage. \n \n(c) The Contractor shall maintain Workers' Compensation and other legally required insurance with \nrespect to the Contractor's own employees and agents. \n \n(d) The Government shall in no event be liable or responsible for damage or injury to any person or \nproperty occasioned through the use, maintenance, or operation of any vehicle or other equipment \nby, or the action of, the Contractor or the Contractor's employees and agents in performing under this \n\ncontract, and the Government shall be indemnified and saved harmless against claims for damage or \ninjury in such cases. \n \n \nC.8 -- LOSS, DAMAGE, OR DESTRUCTION \n \n(a) For equipment furnished under this agreement WITHOUT operator, the Government will assume \nliability for any loss, damage, or destruction of such equipment, except that no reimbursement will be \nmade for loss, damage or destruction due to (1) ordinary wear or tear, (2) mechanical failure, or (3) \nthe fault or negligence of the Contractor or the Contractor's agents or employees or Government \nemployee owned and operated equipment. \n \n(b) For equipment furnished under this agreement WITH operator, the Government shall not be liable \nfor any loss, damage, or destruction of such equipment, except for loss, damage or destruction \nresulting from the negligence, or wrongful act(s) of Government employee(s) while acting within the \nscope of their employment. The operator is responsible for operating the equipment within its \noperating limits and responsible for safety of the equipment. \n \n \nC.9 -- FIREARM - WEAPON PROHIBITION \n \nThe possession of firearms or other dangerous weapons (18 USC 930 (g)(2)) are prohibited at all \ntimes while on Government Property and during performance of services, under this agreement.

Dispatchers will not provide \ninformation, such as \"when or if a Contractor will be called for an assignment\" or \"status of other \ncontractors.\" \n. \nD.6.1 -- DISPATCH PRIORITY. \n. \n(a) During periods of availability, the incident host dispatch center will place the order up to the \nGACC. GACC will place the order to the Contractor whose Designated Dispatch Point is closest to \nthe incident as determined by Google Maps, provided that the unit can meet the incidents needs and \nrequired time frames. In the event there is a tie within .5 mile to determine closest resource, the \nlowest priced daily rate will be the determining factor. \n(1) For initial attack, dispatchers will follow the \"closest forces\" concept and utilize locally available \nresources according to agency and incident needs. The priority dispatch ranking may not be used \nduring initial attack and Contractor resources may or may not be used. \n(2) For prescribed fire project work, dispatchers and ordering units, based on project needs and \nfunding, can employ a local project work commuting area restriction where the ordered resource(s) as \nlisted within the Schedule of Items (SOI) must be within a local commuting distance. This local \ncommuting distance equates to a maximum radius of 50 miles or a distance that the contractor can \nreasonably be expected to travel back and forth daily to the project work site as determined by the \nordering unit. The priority dispatch ranking may not be used during prescribed project work and I-BPA \nContractor resources may or may not be used \n(3) Tribal preference policy established within reservation jurisdiction. \n(4) Government normally will dispatch resources in accordance with this protocol; however, the \nnumber of fire orders in process and actual fire conditions at the time of dispatch may require a \ndeviation from normal procedures to respond effectively to such conditions. Any such deviation will be \nwithin the discretion of Government and will not be deemed a violation of any term or condition of this \n\nAgreement. \n \n(b) Upon receipt of a resource order by a host dispatch center, Government Dispatchers will not hold \nthe Contractor resources in reserve as a contingency force in a non-pay status when that resource is \navailable. \n \n(c) The Forest Service intends to dispatch resources in accordance with D.6.1(a). However, the \nnumber of fire orders in process and actual fire conditions at the time of dispatch may require a \ndeviation from these procedures to respond effectively to such conditions. \n \n(d) When a Contractor agrees to a delivery schedule at the time the order is placed, the Contractor is \nrequired to perform in accordance with the agreed upon schedule. \n. \nD.6.2 -- Not Applicable \nD.6.3 -- Not Applicable \n. \nD.6.4 -- INFORMATION REQUIRED WHEN PLACING ORDERS. \n. \nD.6.4.1 -- Information Provided to the Contractor. \n \n(a) At the time of acceptance of the assignment, the following information will be given to the \nContractor: \n(1) Resource Order Number. \n(2) Incident Order Number and Name of Incident. \n(3) Date and time to report to incident. \n(4) Descriptive location of the designated site where the Contractor shall meet a Government \nrepresentative. A map, if available. \n(5) Incident contact phone number for further information. \n(6) Fire Code/Funding Code. \n. \n(b) Prior to departing for the incident, the Contractor shall provide to dispatch the complete name of \neach person dispatched with the contractor equipment, and the ETD and ETA from point of dispatch. \n. \n(c) Dispatch offices may use a FAX or email to provide a hard copy of the resource order to the \nContractor. \n. \nD.6.5 -- DISPATCHING PROCEDURES. \n. \nD.6.5.1 -- When receiving a dispatch call, the Contractor shall confirm their availability and ability to \n\nmeet specified timeframes. If the Contractor cannot be reached or is not able to meet the time and \ndate needed, the dispatcher may proceed with contacting the next resource on the dispatch priority \nlist. Contractor shall check in at the assignment at the time agreed upon when dispatched. \n. \nD.6.5.2 -- The Government will estimate the travel time to and from the incident. Travel time via \nground transportation shall be calculated by dividing distance (from point of hire to incident, or \nincident to incident or incident to point of hire) by average travel speed of 45 mph, plus applicable rest \ntime. \n. \nD.6.5.3 -- At time of dispatch, a resource order number will be assigned. The Contractor shall furnish \nthe assigned resource order number upon arrival and check in at the incident. \n. \nD.6.5.4 -- The vendor will be paid for travel to and from the incident from the equipment City and \nState they designated in their offer. Vendor must meet date and time needed. \n. \nD.6.6 -- EMERGENCY INCIDENT DRIVING. \n. \nThe Contractor shall follow the driving regulations and work/rest guidelines listed in the NWCG \nStandards for Interagency Incident Business Management. Reference D.21.8.1.2. The Contractor is \nresponsible for complying with all other current Federal, State and Local driving regulations. \n. \nD.6.7 -- WORK/REST, LENGTH OF ASSIGNMENTS, AND PERSONNEL CHANGE OUT. \n. \n(a) Work/rest and length of assignment guidelines are in place to ensure the health and safety of \nincident personnel (work/rest and length of assignment guidelines are not applicable to the equipment \nitself). Additional information about work/rest for incident personnel can be found in the PMS 902 \nNWCG Standards for Interagency Incident Business Management (formerly the Interagency Incident \nBusiness Management Handbook). \n. \n(b) Work/Rest. Contractors shall ensure that their personnel adhere to work/rest guidelines and meet \nthe minimum 2:1 work to rest ratio (for every 2 hours of work or travel, provide 1 hour of sleep and/or \nrest within a 24-hour period). Hours worked that exceed 16 hours in a 24-hour period must be \napproved by the IC or Agency Administrator. Documentation shall include mitigation measures used \nto reduce fatigue. \n. \n(c) Length of Assignment. Contracted resources are not restricted by length of assignment. In order to \nlimit disruption to operations, reduce strain on the ordering system, and reduce unnecessary \nmobilization and demobilization of these resources, vendors are encouraged to utilize and manage a \nresource operator rotation schedule that meets work/rest guidelines and the staffing requirements of \n\nthe resource. Regardless of extension duration, two mandatory days off will be provided prior to the \ntwenty-second day of the assignment. \nTo adhere to length of assignment guidelines and manage the days of rest, the incident has the \noption to: \n(1) Release personnel (and resource) after a 14-day assignment, or \n(2) Allow the Contractor to provide replacement personnel. Replacement personnel are subject to \nwork/rest and length of assignment guidelines and must arrive at the incident fully rested. The \nGovernment will not pay transportation cost for replacement personnel, or \n(3) Allow an extension for personnel assigned to the resource. With the Government's agreement, the \ncontractor may choose to have the personnel remain at the incident base camp and not be placed on \nshift to allow proper rest. The equipment is not paid when the Contractor is off shift in compliance with \nthe length of assignment guidelines. Refer to D.21.8.3(d). Note: Contractor personnel do not need to \ncomplete a Resource Extension Request Form as referenced in the NWCG Standards. Days off must \nbe documented on the Shift Ticket. \n. \nD.6.8 -- DEMOBILIZATION. \n. \nThe Incident Commander will determine the priority of demobilization for both suppression and \nseverity assignments. For all other project work, the Government representative directing and \nmanaging project work for the order Agency determines priority of demobilization. \n. \nD.6.9 -- RELEASE. \n. \nOnce released to the host dispatch center, the Contractor shall not accept new resource orders \ndirectly, nor seek out reassignments. Any new orders will originate from the host dispatch center. \n. \n \n \nD.7 -- PROPERTY \n \nD.7.1 -- ACCOUNTABLE, DURABLE, AND CONSUMABLE GOODS. \n \n(a) Accountable and durable property will not be loaned or exchanged at the incident. The Contractor \nshall arrive at the incident fully outfitted and prepared to perform under the terms of the agreement. If \nthe resource, upon arrival at the incident or during the course of the incident does not have the \nrequired equipment or personal protective equipment, it will be considered noncompliant. The \nContractor may be given 24 hours, or a timeframe designated by a Government representative to \nbring the resource into compliance. (Refer to D.17, Incident Pre-Use Inspection and D.18, \nNoncompliance after Acceptance at Incident). \n\n \n(b) Contractor will be charged for Consumable Goods supplied by the Government and used by the \nresource while Under Hire. The cost of all Consumable Goods, except for those specifically listed \nbelow, shall be deducted from payment to the Contractor. At the Government's discretion, the \nGovernment may provide the following incidental consumable goods at no cost, if available: one-quart \nplastic canteens, plastic sheeting, replacement radio batteries and replacement headlamp batteries, \nas required while under hire. \n \n \nD.8 -- INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED BY CONTRACTOR AT CHECK-IN \n \nThe Contractor shall have a complete copy of their most current agreement in their possession at all \ntimes. The incident may make a photocopy of this agreement; however, it remains the property of the \nContractor. \n \nFull copies of any I-BPA agreement can be downloaded and printed from the VIPR website at: \nhttps://www.fs.usda.gov/business/incident/vipragreements.php?tab=tab_d \n \n \nD.9 -- LAUNDRY SERVICE \n \nIf the Government provides a laundry service at the incident base camp, the Contractor may utilize \nthe service at no cost. \n \n \nD.10 -- CAMPSITE \n \nA campsite may be provided. A campsite, if provided, is limited to the space necessary for sleeping \ntents. The Contractor shall provide sleeping equipment such as tents or shelters, sleeping bags, etc. \nIf the Government cannot provide a campsite, an overnight allowance may be authorized. (See \nD.21.5 Remain Overnight Allowance (RON)). NOTE: Severity Incident assignments and Prescribed \nFire Project Work often are not associated with a formal incident base camp where meals and \ncampsites are provided. An overnight allowance may or may not be authorized and is at the \nGovernment's discretion. \n \nThe government is not responsible for providing space for recreational vehicles (RV), including but \nnot limited to travel trailers and motorhomes. At the governments sole discretion contractors may be \nrequired to relocate RVs away from the incident (ICP, incident base, or camps). \n \n\nIf the contractor is required to relocate an RV the government shall not be responsible for monitoring \noff-site locations nor incur any costs for the offsite camp location including, but not limited to, mileage \nto and from the ICP/remote base camp or fire line assignments, camping fees, utility costs etc. The \ngovernment shall not be responsible for any damages or theft that occur because of the relocation of \nthe RV. \n \n \n \nD.11 -- COMMISSARY \n \nWhen authorized in writing by the Contractor, the Contractor's employees shall be permitted to use \nthe commissary when one is available.  Refer to D.21.8.3(e). \n \n \nD.12 -- TIMEKEEPING \n \nRefer to D.21.9.2 \n \n \nD.13 -- CONTRACTOR'S REPRESENTATIVE \n \nUnless otherwise designated, the contractor's job site foreman shall be considered the Contractor's \nRepresentative for this Agreement. \n \nD.14 -- FIRST AID, MEDICAL COVERAGE AND EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS \n \nD.14.1 -- FIRST AID RESPONSIBILITY. \n \nThe contractor is financially responsible for employee medical expenses and coverage. The \nGovernment may provide first aid at the incident at no charge to the contractor. Any other medical \nexpenses incurred will be the responsibility of the contractor. If contractor personnel become ill or are \ninjured and incident transportation is not available, the Government may evacuate or transport the \ninjured/ill person(s) to a medical facility/hospital utilizing a commercial source (e.g. ground or air \nambulance transport such as Lifeflight). Commercial transport costs will be the responsibility of the \nContractor. \n \nD.14.2 -- MEDICAL INSURANCE. \n \nContractor shall provide the operator(s) with an adequate supply of appropriate insurance forms, \n\ninsurance ID card(s), and other necessary documents. Such documents shall accompany the \ninjured/ill person(s) when the medical need arises. The Government will not track, record, or manage \ncontractor insurance records under this agreement. Insurance coverage and documentation is the \nsole responsibility of the contractor. \n \n \nD.15 -- VEHICLE CLEANING FOR NOXIOUS WEED CONTROL \n \n(a) NOXIOUS WEED CONTROL. \nThe resource shall arrive at the incident or designated inspection point washed and free of noxious \nweed seeds. Equipment with frames and cross-members will be inspected and all debris collecting \nareas including belly pans, guards and coverings must be washed to alleviate the spread of noxious \nweed seeds and to protect against grease and oil-soaked residues catching on fire in belly pans and \nskid plates. Heavy equipment operators shall manually clean tracks and belly pans before leaving \nproject site on all heavy equipment. While at the incident, the Government will normally provide \ncleaning facilities. If the Government requires use of commercial facilities, the Government will \nreimburse the Contractor for these costs based on written receipts. \n \n(b) AQUATIC AND INVASIVE SPECIES (AIS) PREVENTION. \nAll resources under this agreement shall adhere to the requirements of NWCG publication PMS 444, \nGuide to Preventing Aquatic Invasive Species Transport by Wildland Fire Operations, including the \nfollowing measures for Aquatic and Invasive Species prevention: \n \nAll resources that handle water are required to use a functioning foot valve while on assignment. A \nfoot valve must be located at the end of the draft hose; check valves located in the pump, at the tank \nor other locations are not an acceptable alternative. All draft hose(s) and foot valve(s) shall arrive at \nthe incident or designated inspection point clean and dry. The government may, at any time, inspect \nfor compliance with this requirement. \n \n(c) DECONTAMINATING GROUND EQUIPMENT. \nBefore moving to a new water source (in a different watershed), decontaminate all external and \ninternal surfaces of foot valve and draft hose. Three options are: \n1. Power wash with hot water (140 F, allow spray to contact surfaces for 2 minutes) using a hot \npressure washer (e.g., a Hotsy). OR \n2. Dry the gear in the hot sun until completely dry to the touch (sunlight intensifies the \ndecontamination process). OR \n3. Use a chemical solution (see Appendix A: Decontaminating with Chemical Disinfectants). Surfaces \nof the drafting hose and foot valve can be decontaminated by coiling and submerging in a bucket \nfilled with disinfectant or by spray application with a backpack pump or a large spray bottle. Consider \n\ncarrying spare, clean, dry draft hoses and foot valves to switch out with used ones when moving to a \nnew water source. \n*As referenced in the National Wildfire Coordination Group (NWCG) publication PMS 444 Guide to \nPreventing Aquatic Invasive Species Transport by Wildland Fire Operations \n(https://www.nwcg.gov/sites/default/files/publications/pms444.pdf), Chapter 4 Ground Operations. \n \n \nD.16 -- TECHNICAL EVALUATION PROCESS \nD.16.1 -- TECHNICAL EVALUATION \n(a) All resources submitted must pass a Technical Evaluation prior to being considered for award. \nSee technical quote submittal requirements listed in SECTION E -- SOLICITATION PROVISIONS: \nE.1 -- INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS and E.2 -- INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING TECHNICAL \nQUOTES. \n \nD.16.2 -- POST AWARD INSPECTION \n \n(a) All or partial resources offered within your VIPR quote may be selected for follow-on hands-on \ninspection by the Regional Contract Operations program representative.  Those inspections will be \ncoordinated and conducted by that representative. You can find your regional POC at this website \nunder Contract Operation Specialist: \nhttps://www.fs.usda.gov/business/incident/contacts.php?tab=tab_c. \n \n \nD.17 -- INCIDENT PRE-USE INSPECTION \n \n(a) All resources furnished under this agreement shall be in acceptable condition. The Government \nreserves the right to reject resources that are not in safe and operable condition. Prior to incident use \nor anytime the resource is under hire, the Government may perform inspections. \n \n(b) If the resource does not pass inspection at the incident or designated inspection station, it is \nconsidered noncompliant. The Contractor may be given 24 hours or time frame designated by \nGovernment representatives to bring the resource into compliance. If the resource does come into \ncompliance within the time granted by the government representative, payment will be made for travel \nto and from the incident or point of inspection, no payment will be made for the time that the resource \nwas not available. If the resource does not pass inspection, no payment will be made for travel to the \nincident or point of inspection or return to the point of hire, or for the time that the resource was not \navailable. Upon rejection, resource will be removed from the dispatch priority list until such time that \nthe resource is brought into compliance and re-inspected at the government's convenience. Repeated \nfailures at the pre-use incident inspection may be grounds for cancellation of the Agreement. \n\n \nD.17.1 -- INSPECTION REPORTS. Copies of the incident inspection reports and related \ndocumentation shall be distributed as follows: \n \n(a) The original shall remain with the fire documents on Host Unit. \n \n(b) A copy of the inspection shall be given to the Contractor and/or the Contractor's Representative. \n \n(c) A duplicate copy shall be forwarded to the CO for all non-compliant resources. \n \n \nD.18 -- NONCOMPLIANCE AFTER ACCEPTANCE AT THE INCIDENT \n \nIf the resource is released due to noncompliance, documentation shall be immediately forwarded, by \nthe Incident Management Team to the Contracting Officer; and the resource will be removed from the \ndispatch priority list until such time that the resource is brought into compliance and re-inspected at \nthe government's convenience (See D.21.8.3(c)). Due to priority of direct support during the fire \nseason, Government workers may be unavailable for both inspections and modifications for an \nextended period of time. Repeated notices of noncompliance may be grounds for cancellation of the \nAgreement. \n \n \nD.19 -- WORKMANSHIP \n \n(a) All work under this Agreement shall be performed in a safe manner to a professional and \nworkmanlike standard. The goal of performance under this Agreement is the suppression of wildland \nfire and other emergency incident responses. The Incident Commander may release from an incident \nassignment any Contractor employee deemed incompetent, unprofessional, careless, or otherwise \nobjectionable including violation of Harassment Free Workplace Policy (Exhibit C). It will be left to the \ndiscretion of the Incident Commander to demobilize an entire resource or to allow replacement of the \nnoncompliant personnel. Documentation of the rationale for release will be provided to the CO \nsubsequent to the action. Accordingly, the Contracting Officer may require, in writing, the Contractor \nremove from use under this Agreement, any employee found incompetent, unprofessional, careless, \nor otherwise objectionable including violation of Harassment Free Workplace Policy. The Contracting \nOfficer may require other proof of mitigation. Misconduct may result in the suspension or cancellation \nof this Agreement. \n \n(b) Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring all it's employees wear proper incident attire, as \nfollows (PPE, if required for specific resources, will be detailed in the agreement at D.2): \n\n(1) FOOTWEAR: Closed toe shoes must be worn while providing services on an incident assignment. \nSandals and/or flip flops are not acceptable footwear while working on an incident. \n(2) CLOTHING: Clothing must be appropriate for the conditions and wildfire/incident setting. This \nmeans long or short sleeve shirts and full-length pants or jeans. \nThe Incident Commander may release from an incident assignment any Contractor employee who is \nnot wearing proper incident attire in accordance with D.19 -- Workmanship. \n \n(c) If an employee or crew is terminated, quits, or otherwise is released from the incident for any \nreason, the Contractor is responsible for returning the employee(s) to the point of hire with a \ndeparture time from the Incident Command Post (ICP) no later than 12 hours or time specified by a \ngovernment official following such decision. The Contractor may, at their discretion, provide such \ntransportation, or request the Incident Management Team (IMT) to arrange for the transportation with \nall transportation costs deducted from Contractor's payment. If the Contractor does not act in a timely \nmanner (i.e., Contractor's employee(s) not departing from the ICP for return to point of hire within the \nspecified time period), the IMT has authority to transport said employee or arrange for employee's \ntransportation and to deduct all such transportation costs from Contractor's payment. \n \nD.19.1 -- INCIDENT BEHAVIOR. \n \nIt is extremely important that inappropriate behavior be recognized and dealt with promptly. \nInappropriate behavior is all forms of harassment including sexual and racial harassment. \nHARASSMENT IN ANY FORM WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. Non-prescription and Federally unlawful \ndrugs and alcohol are not permitted at the incident. Possession or use of these substances will result \nin the Contractor being released from the incident. During off-incident periods, personnel are \nresponsible for proper conduct and maintenance of fitness for duty. Drug or alcohol abuse resulting in \nunfitness for duty will normally result in the Contractor being released from the incident. Sexual \nharassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favors, and other verbal or \nphysical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to such \nconduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, (2) \nsubmission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment \ndecisions affecting such individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably \ninterfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive \nworking environment. \n \n \nD.20 -- PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS \n \nPerformance evaluations will be performed at the incident using the form in Exhibit E. The evaluation \nwill be completed at the incident by the government representative supervising the work. This form is \n\nthe preferred performance evaluation to be accepted by the Contracting Officer. The evaluator's \nsignature shall be legible and printed on the form. If the supervising Government representative is \nreleased from the incident prior to the release of the resource, the government representative will \ncomplete a performance evaluation prior to demobilization, for work the resource performed under \ntheir supervision. The Government representative will review the performance evaluation with the \nContractor, record Contractor comments, and obtain the Contractor's signature acknowledging \ncompletion of the evaluation. The Government evaluator will then give a copy of the evaluation \nform(s) to the Contractor at the incident and submit a copy to the incident Finance Section (for \ndistribution to the Contracting Office and the Host unit incident file). Completed Performance \nEvaluations can be emailed to the following email address: Perform.ct5w8ujitbvot9yi@u.box.com. \n \n \nD.21 -- PAYMENTS \n \n(a) Payments will be made in accordance with D.21.8. \n \n(b) When equipment is ordered for severity assignments as Prescribed Fire Project Work, the \nfollowing payment will be made: \n \n(c) Table D.21 -- SEVERITY INCIDENTS & PRESCRIBED FIRE PROJECT RATES \n \nSeverity Incidents & Prescribed Fire Project Rates are paid at 75% of the daily rate for 10 hours or \nless, excluding meal breaks. For greater than 10 hours, including travel time, the full daily rate \napplies. \n \nSeverity only: If a resource is mobilized to an incident within the 10-hour severity period the payment \nwill revert to the full daily rate. If the mobilization occurs outside the 10-hour severity period they will \nbe released from their severity assignment and the suppression rates will be applied under the first \nand last day language of the Agreement. In no case shall the daily rate be exceeded. \n(1) Severity Incident assignments & Prescribed Fire Project Work are at the discretion of the \nContractor to accept or reject. Rejecting either a severity assignment or prescribed fire project work \nwill not affect placement on the suppression dispatch priority list (DPL) or preclude a Contractor from \nbeing offered a suppression assignment at full daily rate. \n(2) Severity Incident assignments & Prescribed Fire Project Work often are not associated with a \nformal incident base camp where meals and campsites are provided. If a base camp is not \nestablished, RON (see D.21.5) may or may not be authorized at the Government's discretion, and this \nallowance will be annotated on the Resource Order (RO). \n \nD.21.1 -- BRIEFINGS. \n\n \nAll operators/Contractor Representatives shall attend operational period briefings. This is included in \nthe daily rate. \n \nD.21.2 -- WITHDRAWAL OF RESOURCE(S). \n \nRefer to D.21.8.3(b). \n \nD.21.3 -- REPAIRS. \n \nRepairs shall be made and paid for by the Contractor. The Government may, at its option, elect to \nmake such repairs when necessary to keep the resource operating. The cost of such repairs will be \n$100 per hour, plus parts and will be deducted from payment to the contractor. \n \nD.21.4 -- OPERATING SUPPLIES. \n \nEven though this agreement may specify that all operating supplies are to be furnished by the \nContractor, the Government may, at its option, elect to furnish such supplies when necessary to keep \nthe resource operating. The cost of such supplies will be determined by the Government and \ndeducted from payment to the Contractor. \n \nD.21.5 -- REMAIN OVERNIGHT ALLOWANCE (RON). \n \n(a) Contractors under this agreement are not paid per diem or lodging expenses to and from \nincidents. \n \n(b) When the Government cannot provide a campsite after the first shift worked, the Government will \npay actual lodging expenses or the per diem locality rate published by the U.S. General Services \nAdministration (GSA) web site (www.gsa.gov), whichever is less. Double occupancy of hotel rooms is \nrequired. If the crew has an odd number of male or female crew members, an additional room may be \nauthorized. Any associated lodging taxes are reimbursable as documented. Lodging receipts, as well \nas documentation by incident personnel that a campsite was not provided, shall be submitted as \nsupporting documentation with payment documents. \n \n(c) Reimbursement for meals and incidental expenses (M&IE) is based on per diem locality rates \nminus any Government-provided meals. The maximum allowable rates are referenced at \nwww.gsa.gov. As with lodging, actual meal expenses may be authorized as coordinated in advance \nand managed by the Host Agency and/or IMT. \n \n\n(d) If warranted by a lack of available lodging at established rates, actual lodging expenses may be \nauthorized. Authorization must be coordinated in advance and documented in writing by a Host \nAgency Administrator (AA) or local Agency Incident Business Specialist on either an ICS-213 general \nmessage form in or in the remarks on the Resource Order (RO). Actuals will not exceed the current \nFTR allowances per FTR Bulletin 18-09 or latest published bulletin  calculating actual expense \nreimbursement located here: https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulation/federal-travel-\nregulation?gsaredirect=ftr. \n \n(e) If the resource is allowed to return to its dispatch location during off-shift time, RON allowance is \nnot authorized. \n \n(f) The maximum RON that shall be allowed is based on the number of operators or crewmembers \nshown on the shift ticket. Payment shall be included as an addition on the OF-286 Emergency \nEquipment Use Invoice. \n \nD.21.6 -- FOOD & DRINK. \n \n(a) Contractors are required to provide sufficient food & drink to support their employee(s) while in \ntravel status and the first shift of the incident. This is not reimbursed by the Government. \n \n(b) After that time, when Government subsistence at incident camps is available, meals for \nContractor's operator(s) will be furnished without charge. Government will furnish meals without cost \nif restaurant subsistence is the approved camp for incident personnel. \n \n(c) The Government, during demobilization and/or reassignment, may provide sack lunches to the \nContractor personnel without charging the Contractor. \n \n(d) Severity Incident assignments & Prescribed Fire Project Work often are not associated with a \nformal incident base camp where meals and campsites are provided. If a base camp is not \nestablished, RON (see D.21.5) and FOOD & DRINK (D.21.6) may or may not be authorized at the \nGovernment's discretion, and this allowance will be annotated on the Resource Order (RO). \n \nD.21.7 -- ORDER CANCELLATION. \n \nOrder cancellation/enroute. If the order is cancelled after the resource order has been confirmed, and \nthe resource is enroute, the resource is considered mobilized. Payment will be made by the host \nagency in accordance with D.21.8. \n \nD.21.8 -- PAYMENTS. \n\n \n(a) The ordering agency is responsible for payments. Payments for resources shared between \nincidents without reassignment in IROC will be the responsibility of the original ordering agency. See \nExhibit B for complete agency payment office information. \n \n(b) The time under hire shall start at the time the resource begins traveling to the incident after being \nordered by the Government, and end at the estimated time of arrival back to the point of hire after \nbeing released, except as provided in D.21.8.3. \n \n(c) The minimum daily guarantee for the transport is applicable to time under hire as defined in \nD.21.8. \n \nD.21.8.1 -- Rates of Payments. Payment will be at rates specified and, except as provided in \nD.21.8.3, shall be in accordance with the following: \n \n(a) \nOn-Shift includes time worked, time that resource is held or directed to be in a state of \nreadiness, and compensable travel (resource traveling under its own power) that has a specific start \nand ending time. \n \n(b) \nPAYMENT WILL BE MADE AT THE RATE (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY) THAT IS MOST \nADVANTAGEOUS TO THE GOVERNMENT REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF DAYS \nWORKED. FOR PAYMENT PURPOSES, THE PAYMENT COMPUTATION WILL BE CALCULATED \nUSING ANY COMBINATION OF RATES (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY) THAT IS MOST \nADVANTAGEOUS TO THE GOVERNMENT. \n \nFOR EXAMPLE, IF THE AGREEMENT HAS A DAILY RATE OF $1200, A WEEKLY RATE OF \n$7000, AND A MONTHLY RATE OF $17,000 AND THE TIME UNDER HIRE IS 17 DAYS, THE \nGOVERNMENT WILL PAY THE VENDOR $17,000 AS THE MONTHLY RATE IS THE MOST \nADVANTAGEOUS RATE. \n \n(c) Equipment relocation is allowable, however, requests shall be documented and approved through \nthe respective Incident Management Team internal procedures. Payment will be made in accordance \nwith the listed Schedule of Items within this agreement - Flat Rate Fee per trailer/tent unit. \n \nD.21.8.1.1 -- The vendor will be paid for travel to and from the incident from the equipment City and \nState they designated in their offer.

These diﬀerentials  \nare only applicable to work that has been speciﬁcally designated by the agency for ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material \ndiﬀerential pay. \n \n** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** \n \n\nIf employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by \nthe employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) \nsuch uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by \nthe wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: \n \nThe contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to \nreimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the \nresponsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona \nﬁde collective bargaining agreement providing for a diﬀerent amount, or the furnishing of contrary aﬃrmative proof as to the actual \ncost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in  \nthose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of \"wash and wear\" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with \nother personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in \norder to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by \nthe nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. \n \n** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS ** \n \nThe duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the \"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations\", Fifth \nEdition (Revision 1), dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated. \n \nREQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE Standard Form 1444 (SF-1444) \n \nConformance Process: \n \nThe contracting oﬃcer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under \nthe contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classiﬁcation listed in the wage determination), be classiﬁed by \nthe contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted \nclassiﬁcations and the classiﬁcations listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the \nmonetary wages and furnished the fringe beneﬁts as are determined (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be \ninitiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees (See 29 CFR \n4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a ﬁnal determination of conformed classiﬁcation, wage rate, and/or fringe \nbeneﬁts which shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iv)(C)(vi)). When multiple wage \ndeterminations are included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is \nto be conformed. \n \nThe process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: \n \n1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identiﬁes the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). \n \n2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order the proposed classiﬁcation title(s), a Federal grade \nequivalency (FGE) for each proposed classiﬁcation(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including \ninformation regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is \nno authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting oﬃcer no later than 30 \ndays after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. \n \n3) The contracting oﬃcer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's \nrecommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour \nDivision, U.S. Department of Labor, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). \n \n4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modiﬁes, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency \ncontracting oﬃcer, or notiﬁes the contracting oﬃcer that additional time will be required to process the request. \n \n5) The contracting oﬃcer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. \n \n6) The contractor informs the aﬀected employees. \n \nInformation required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper. \n \n\nWhen preparing a conformance request, the \"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations\" (the Directory) should be used to \ncompare job deﬁnitions to ensure that duties requested are not performed by a classiﬁcation already listed in the wage \ndetermination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established \nwage determination. Conformances may not be used to artiﬁcially split, combine, or subdivide classiﬁcations listed in the wage \ndetermination. \n \n** OCCUPATIONS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SCA DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **        \n \nAircraft Quality Control Inspector \nDevelops and implements quality control and ground safety programs to ensure compliance with contract speciﬁcations.
